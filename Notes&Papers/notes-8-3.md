- Papers that I need to read:
  1. Identifying reasons for software changes using historic databases (2000)
  2. Populating a release history database from version control and bug tracking systems (2003)
  3. When do changes induce fixes? (2005)
  4. Discriminating development activities in versioning systems: A case study (2006)
  5. Automatic classification of large changes into maintenance categories (2009)
  6. Classifying change types for qualifying change couplings (2006)
  7. Handling missing values when applying classification models (2007)

  - Things that I need to understand:
    1. Kappa score

  - Other new things which I found :
    1. They used software's issue tracking system for more reliability (JIRA). It contained tickets of categories such as 'bug', 'feature request', etc. But it was found that the developers were not consistent in their use of this.   
    2. Drop commits if you are not able to classify it with satisfactory confidence.
    3. Use rules of thumb like classify 'Java doc and comment updates' as perfective and likewise.
    4. The subject of dealing with missing values in a classification problem is broadly covered in the paper: "Handling missing values when applying classification models".
